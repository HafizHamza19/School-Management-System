    <p><center>The Tes team explores the reasons why there has been a big increase in the number of assistant headteachers
Join <br />the Tes team as we talk about some of the biggest issues of the week.
We look at the dramatic rise in the number of <br />assistant headteachers in recent years, and try to unpick what might be lying behind it - as well as the impact it might be having on<br /> teacher workload.
We also discuss a very well paid primary leader, and ask how widespread <br />such high salaries are in the non-academy sector.
And we talk about the problem that you might see outside your schools<br /> gates everyday: parking, parents and local residents. </center></p></marquee>
